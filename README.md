# quicksort
This is the 4th homework in my csci 333 class which is the second course on data structures at UNC Asheville. 
Here we had to make a method for quicksort which sorts an array using the quicksort algorithm, and we also had
to make a method for randomizedQuicksort which is pretty similar to quicksort, but ensures a better runtime
by randomizing the pivot choice.
